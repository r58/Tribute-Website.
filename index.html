                    Brett Lee, the tearaway Australian pacer is regarded as one of the greatest exponents of pace bowling in world cricket. Blessed with a rare ability to bowl fast along with reverse swing in his armory, Lee became one of the pillars of the intimidating Australian pace attack of the 20.
                    Born on 8th November 1976, Lee was fascinated to cricket and always dreamt of being the fastest bowler in the world. He started his cricketing career by playing for the junior team of the local side, Oak Flat Rats.
                    Gradually, he made it to the New South Wales team on the back of some impressive performances for U-17 and U-19 Australian teams.
                    Lee made his ODI debut in 2000 against Pakistan and became one of the cornerstones of the pace attack since then.
                    He turned a new chapter in his cricketing career at the World Cup in 2003 where his 22 wickets played a pivotal role in Australia winning the trophy. He also recorded a hat trick against Kenya, becoming the first Australian bowler to do so.
